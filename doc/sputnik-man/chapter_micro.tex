\chapter*{\micro}

\section{Introduction}

The \micro was designed to calculate the average properties on micro-structures. 
It uses ParMETIS and PETSc libraries to partition the domain and solving the equilibrium problem in parallel.

This code uses the main \sputnik routines for the mesh treatment and assembly operations and it design in a very
minimalistic way focusing on achieve high performance retrieving fast as possible The homogenized values.

\section{Methods}

The code can operate in \emph{coupling} or \emph{standalone} mode. The \emph{coupling} will generally be used to
perform multi-scale calculations coupling \macro with \micro as:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language=bash]
<@\textcolor{blue}{mpirun}@> -np <np_M> <@\textcolor{OliveGreen}{macro}@> -coupl [OPTIONS_M] : -np <np_m> <@\textcolor{OliveGreen}{micro}@> -coupl [OPTIONS_m]
\end{lstlisting}

Notice the using of the \verb -coupl  option.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language=bash]
<@\textcolor{blue}{mpirun}@> -np <np_m> <@\textcolor{OliveGreen}{micro}@> [OPTIONS_m]
\end{lstlisting}
