Here therethe group of scripts to perform a 
series of calculation that are done to calculate 
the accuracy of multi-sacale calculation using 
Mixing theory and Linear displacement homogenization
approach.

scripts:

run_1    : runs 4 cases with frontal fibers
           a) direct 
           b) homogenization uniform strains
           c) taylor parallel
           d) taylor serial

run_5    : runs 4 cases with transversal fibers with Dirichlet b.c. on X
           a) direct 
           b) homogenization uniform strains
           c) taylor parallel
           d) taylor serial

run_6    : runs 4 cases with transversal fibers with Dirichlet b.c. on Y
           a) direct 
           b) homogenization uniform strains
           c) taylor parallel
           d) taylor serial


meshes:


direct_1 : macroscopic structured 2d grid of frontal fibers and matrix


direct_2 : macroscopic structured 2d grid of transversal fiber and matrix


homoge   : macroscopic structured grid for multiscale calculation


rve_1    : non-structured 2D grid of matrix + fiber with different
           refinements

rve_2    : structured 2D grids of rve cells with different refinements


rve_3    : structured 2D grids of rve cells with different refinements
           and different sizes (proportional)

rve_4    : structured 2d grids of a transversal fiber
