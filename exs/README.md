### macro_alone

Example of a boundary condition problem. 
The "-eigensys" or a "-normal" execution can be selected.

Dimension: 2
Geometry : Square, we can use triangles or quads.

### micro_hom

Example of a simple homogenization that can be perform using :

  *  uniform strains 
  *  parallel mixture theory 
  *  serial mixture theory 

Dimension: 2
Geometry : the microstructure is a simple circular fiber.

### fron_fib

Example where the heterogeneities are solved by the direct method and by the homogenization using:

  *  uniform strains 
  *  parallel mixture theory 
  *  serial mixture theory 

Dimension: 2
Geometry : A square piece of composite with fiber perpendicular to the plane

### tran_fib

Example where the heterogeneities are solved by the direct method and by the homogenization using:

  *  uniform strains 
  *  parallel mixture theory 
  *  serial mixture theory 

Dimension: 2
Geometry : A square piece of composite with fiber transversal to the plane
