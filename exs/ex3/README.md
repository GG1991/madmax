## Eigensystem simulations


simulations of a 2D eigenvalue problem
 a) Simulation of the direct problem
 b) Simulation using multiscale approach
 c) Simulation using parallel mixture theory
 d) Simulation using serial mixture theory

In all the simulation E_i, v_i, v_m remains the same 
 we vary first  E_m from E_m / E_m_0 = 1 to E_m / E_m_0 = 1000
 we vary second r_m from m_m / r_m_0 = 1 to r_m / r_m_0 = 1000

 we print the eigenvalue on screen and we take it with awk
