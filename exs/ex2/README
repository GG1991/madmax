Here therethe group of scripts to perform a 
series of calculation that are done to calculate 
the accuracy of multi-sacale calculation using 
Mixing theory and Linear displacement homogenization
approach.


meshes:


direct : macroscopic structured grid with all details of fiber
         and matrix

homoge : macroscopic structured grid for multiscale calculation


rve_1 : non-structured 2D grid of matrix + fiber with different
        refinements

rve_2 : structured 2D grids of rve cells with different refinements


rve_3 : structured 2D grids of rve cells with different refinements
        and different sizes (proportional)

rve_4 : structured 2d grids of a transversal fiber
